## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?

Git is a version controll system that allows multipal parties to work on a project at the same time. They have the ability to create changes to copied versions of the original and submit back to the main branch for final approval.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

Git on its own is a set of commands that are used in a terminal like Gitbash where GitHub is the online version control system that connects with both the local terminal, repositories local and remote.

3. Why do we create a branch?

The branch is  used to show the different changes that have been made by a user or developer which then will be reviewed by an aproval process before being alowed to be pushed to the main code.
 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?

This is a command to download a updated version of a remote repository to the local version being worked on.

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.

git checkout or git branch and the name

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?

git fetch is can take from another repository or URL. (had to look this one up)
git merge  is putting the local changes that you have made to a copied repository with the main repository or code and create a full working version with all the new edited parts
git pull is to update a local repository. (I think it overwrites the local but not sure)

7. What is a merge conflict?

a merge conflict is when edits of the same line of code have been made and are being attempted to be merged to the main branch.

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?

It would make sense to me to check both brances to see which is correct, then make sure the other is edited correctly and do a new commit.
